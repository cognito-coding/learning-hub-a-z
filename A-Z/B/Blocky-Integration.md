# ✅ Best Tool for the Job: Google Blockly

| Feature | Why Use It |
|---------|------------|
| Blockly | Mature, open-source block coding framework |
| Multi-language export | Can generate Lua, Python, JS from blocks |
| Custom block creation | You can build game-specific logic blocks (e.g. Sprint, Move, Jump) |
| Embeds cleanly in Vue | JS-native, no iframe needed |

## 🧱 How Blockly Fits Into Your Stack

| Area | Details |
|------|---------|
| Frontend | Blockly runs in its own Vue component pane |
| Code Output | Converts blocks → text (Lua, Python, JS) into Monaco |
| Assignment Format | Each step can specify: “Use blocks” or “Use code” |
| Student Flow | Beginner sees Blockly, hits “Switch to code” to view equivalent Lua/Python |
| Progress Tracking | Same system as text editor assignments |

## 🧠 Example Workflow

1. **Assignment Step 1:** “Make the character move forward”  
2. Student drags blocks → Blockly code  
3. Presses “Run” or “Convert to code”  
4. Monaco shows Lua/Python equivalent  
5. Step test is run on generated code

## 🛠️ Echo Recommends:
- Add Blockly as a first-class component
- Include a “block → code” toggle per assignment step
- Build early lessons in block mode, advanced ones in code mode
- Define Roblox-flavored blocks later for custom logic
