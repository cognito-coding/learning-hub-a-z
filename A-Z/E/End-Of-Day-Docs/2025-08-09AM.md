# Day 2 — Completion Log

## Context
Day 2 of building the **Cognito Coding Learning Hub** focused on creating the working foundation for both frontend and backend, integrating Blockly, and setting up core infrastructure.

---

## Achievements

### 1. Codespaces Devcontainer
- Added `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` with Node.js 20 + Python 3.11.
- Forwarded ports: 5173 (frontend) and 8000 (backend).
- Configured VS Code extensions for Python, ESLint, Prettier.

### 2. Frontend Scaffold
- Created `frontend/` using **Vite + React**.
- Installed `blockly` and `react-router-dom`.
- Added `/playground` route rendering Blockly workspace with basic Logic & Math categories.

### 3. Backend Scaffold
- Created `backend/` with FastAPI.
- Added `/ping` route.
- Enabled CORS for local dev.

### 4. Auth Skeleton
- Added `auth` route group with `/auth/github` and `/auth/github/callback` stubs.

### 5. Assignments API
- Created `assignments` route group.
- Serves static JSON files from `backend/data/assignments`.
- Tested with `hello-world` assignment.

### 6. Docker Compose
- `docker-compose.yml` to run frontend + backend together with hot reload.

### 7. Repo Coordination
- Verified GitHub org has all required repos:
  - `cognito-coding-learning-hub` (main platform)
  - `assignments-library` (done earlier)
  - `blockly-engine` (Day 2)
  - `hub-docs` (done earlier)

## Win Condition Met
Day 2 target was **Steps 1–4** of the project plan — exceeded by also completing Steps 5–7.

The Learning Hub now runs end-to-end in Codespaces:
- Frontend at port 5173
- Backend at port 8000
- Basic Blockly integration
- Static assignment loading via API

---

## Day 3 Preview
**First Task:** Add Lua + Python code generation buttons to `/playground` so blocks can be converted into executable scripts.

Following that:
- Style Blockly workspace + toolbox to match branding.
- Expand Assignments API to support categories and metadata.
