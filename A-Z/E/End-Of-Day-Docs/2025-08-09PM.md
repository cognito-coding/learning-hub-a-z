## 1. Yesterday‚Äôs Summary
- Continued Python-only run support, stable output for stacked prints.
- Added Lua and JavaScript code generation (Lua outputs `print(...)`, JS now outputs `console.log(...)` instead of `window.alert`).
- Confirmed multi-language block generation works: Python, Lua, JavaScript.
- Set up UI layout in **PlaygroundLayout.jsx** with categories, assignment metadata.
- Restored previous design after major file changes disrupted layout.

---

## 2. Carry-Over Tasks
- Expand Assignments API to return categories and metadata.
- Link assignments to frontend for dynamic loading.

---

## 3. Today‚Äôs Priorities
1. Fix JavaScript generator to output `console.log(...)` ‚Äî ‚úÖ Done.
2. Maintain separate files for **Playground.jsx**, **PlaygroundLayout.jsx**, **PlaygroundTools.js**.
3. Keep Python, Lua, JS code generation in sync.
4. Restore and protect original layout styling ‚Äî ‚úÖ Done.

---

## 4. New Ideas / Future Tasks
- Add HTML & CSS generator placeholders.
- Add Lua runtime execution via Fengari.
- Enable JavaScript runtime execution in-browser.
- Auto-insert ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù starter block for each language.
- Provide code comments in generated output for learning purposes.

## 5. Issues / Blockers
- Assignment system is still static; no backend integration.
- Only Python can be executed in-browser right now.
- No GitHub OAuth or dashboard implemented yet.

---

## 6. End of Day Review

**Done:**
- JavaScript generator changed from `window.alert(...)` to `console.log(...)`.

**Pushed to tomorrow:**
- Link assignments API with categories/metadata.
- Begin dynamic assignment loading on frontend.
- Add Lua runtime execution.

**Still blocked by:**

---

## Day 4 Plan
- **Complete GitHub OAuth flow.**
- **Add student dashboard and assignment runner.**
- **Implement GitHub export for student code.**
- **Add educator/admin tools for creating assignments.**
- Add Lua runtime execution via Fengari.
- Begin linking assignments dynamically to categories.
