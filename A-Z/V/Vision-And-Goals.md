# Vision & Goals

**Project Codename:** LearnHub  
**Goal:** Replace multiple fragmented teaching tools (Scratch, Trinket, Roblox Studio, CodeMonkey, Replit) with a single, web-based coding platform that supports step-by-step learning, multiple languages, and portfolio building.

## Key Objectives
- One login, one environment for all lessons.
- Support **block coding** for beginners and **text coding** for advanced users.
- Work with **Lua, Python, JavaScript** (Roblox Lua as a special case).
- Allow teachers to set **step-based assignments** with live tests.
- Enable students to **export completed work to GitHub** as part of a portfolio.
- Track progress for both individual learners and classrooms.
